# ansible-playbooks-template

This repository contains a small collection of Ansible Playbooks for managing linux server, users, updates, etc.

![Network Architecture](https://github.com/davift/ansible-playbooks-template/raw/main/screenshot1.png)

Out of the box these playbooks are fully functional as long as the service accounts (`ansible`) for SSH and MySQL connection are created.

Feel free to build on top of it and suggest additional functionalities via Pull Request.
